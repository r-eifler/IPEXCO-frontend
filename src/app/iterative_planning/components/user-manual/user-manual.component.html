                <p>
                    Planning is the process of finding a sequence of actions that will go from an initial state to a target state. This target state can be defined by a set of goals that we want to achieve. Here we are considering tasks where due to limited resources and time
                    not all goals can be achieved. Several possible plans that don't all satisfy the same goals are thus acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your role is <span class="highlight">not</span> to find plans, but to give the right instructions to an automated planner. To help you to do this, we provide you with an <span class="highlight">explanation interface</span> described at the bottom of this page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below you can see a list of sample goals of activities that you want to schedule,
                    but due to limited time and space in your car this is not possible.
                    Each goal is assigned a utility indicated on the right with
                    <mat-icon>workspace_premium</mat-icon>.
                    The utility indicates how important the goal is.
                    If you click on the panel, you get a more details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A goal marked with a <mat-icon>lock</mat-icon> must <span class="highlight">always</span> be satisfied. It is automatically selected
                    and you cannot deselect it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your task is to find a trade-off between the goals that can be achieved.
                    This means you must find a selection of goals that can be achieved and that
                    <span class="highlight">maximizes the utility</span>.
                    Each selection of goals is called an <span class="highlight">Iteration Step.</span>

                <p>
                    As orientation we display the maximal possible utility and
                    the highest achieved utility as shown below in the top of the list of iteration steps.

                    If you create a new iteration step the tool will check whether it is possible to achieve

                    Below you see a list of three iteration steps, each with a different status.

                    To navigate between iteration steps you can use the list of all iteration steps.

                <h3>Unsolvable Step</h3>

                <p>
                    For an unsolvable step the list of the enforced goals is shown. In our example step from above this
                    is:
                </p>

                <h4>Enforced Goals</h4>
                <div class="property-list">

                </div>

                <h3>Solvable Step</h3>

                <p>
                    For a solvable step in addition to the list of the enforced goals the unsatisfied and additionally satisfied (but not enforced)
                    goals are shown. Note that the tool does not try to achieve the goals that are not enforced.
                    Nevertheless, they might be satisfied by chance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For our sample step this looks as follows:

                    To facilitate the selection of goals the tool can provide explanations for user questions.
                    Below we explain how you can ask the tool questions.
                    Beware that the explanations can help you to understand the conflicts but won't help you to choose what choice of goals maximizes the utility. This is your task.

                        <p>
                            The tool is mainly designed to answer questions like:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Why is this step unsolvable?</li>
                            <li>How can I make this step solvable?</li>
                            <li>Why isn't this goal satisfied?</li>
                            <li>Can this goal be enforced while keeping the other enforced goals?</li>
                            <li>What if I enforce this goal?</li>
                            <li>How can I achieve this goal?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Beware that the chat assistant cannot answer questions about multiple goals at once.
                            If you want to ask about multiple goals, you have to ask about each goal separately.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tool remembers previous questions and answers and thus supports follow-up questions
                            implicitly referencing previous ones, like in the following example:
                        </p>

                            The explainer can infer missing parts in partially implicit question and tells you how it
                            understood your question.
                            For example:

                        <p>
                            You can try any question you want. The explainer will try to answer it and if it does not
                            understand your question it will ask you to clarify it. However, the chat explainer is not aware of the utility of goals and thus cannot help you to choose the goals that maximize the utility. It can only help you to understand the conflicts and to find sets of goals that are enforceable.
