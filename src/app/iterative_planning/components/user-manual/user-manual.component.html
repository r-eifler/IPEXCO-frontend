                <p>
                    Planning is the process of finding a sequence of actions that will go from an initial state to a target state. This target state can be defined by a set of goals that we want to achieve. Here we are considering tasks where due to limited resources and time
                    not all goals can be achieved. Several possible plans that don't all satisfy the same goals are thus acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your role is <span class="highlight">not</span> to find plans, but to give the right instructions to an automated planner. To help you to do this, we provide you with an <span class="highlight">explanation interface</span> described at the bottom of this page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below you can see a list of sample goals of activities that you want to schedule,
                    but due to limited time and space in your car this is not possible.
                    Each goal is assigned a utility indicated on the right with
                    <mat-icon>workspace_premium</mat-icon>.
                    The utility indicates how important the goal is.
                    If you click on the panel, you get more details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A goal marked with a <mat-icon>lock</mat-icon> must <span class="highlight">always</span> be satisfied. It is automatically selected
                    and you cannot deselect it.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Your task is to find a trade-off between the goals that can be achieved.
                    This means you must find a selection of goals that can be achieved and that
                    <span class="highlight">maximizes the utility</span>.
                    Each selection of goals is called an <span class="highlight">Iteration Step.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As orientation we display the maximal possible utility and
                    the highest achieved utility as shown below in the top of the list of iteration steps.

                    If you create a new iteration step the tool will check whether it is possible to achieve
                    all the enforced goals.
                    Below you see a list of three iteration steps, each with a different status.

                <h3>Unsolvable Step</h3>

                <p>
                    For an unsolvable step the list of the enforced goals is shown. In our example step from above this
                    is:
                </p>

                <h4>Enforced Goals</h4>
                <div class="property-list">

                </div>

                <h3>Solvable Step</h3>

                <p>
                    For a solvable step in addition to the list of the enforced goals the unsatisfied and additionally satisfied (but not enforced)
                    goals are shown. Note that the tool does not try to achieve the goals that are not enforced.
                    Nevertheless, they might be satisfied by chance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For our sample step this looks as follows:

                    To facilitate the selection of goals the tool can provide explanations for user questions.
                    Below we explain how you can ask questions to the tool.
                    Beware that the explanations can help you to understand the conflicts but won't help you to choose what choice of goals maximizes the utility. This is your task.

                          <app-label color="error">Unsolvable</app-label> you have access to different visualization
                          variants.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                          <li> You can click on the squares in the matrix to either <strong>enforce or unenforce</strong> goals depending on the step.
                            In both cases, you will be provided with a selection result to see the effects of each action. </li>
                          <li> A row within the matrix represents a specific goal whose name can be seen on the y-axis (to the very left of the matrix). </li>
                          <li> Squares represents the interaction of a goal with another. Each square is attributed a different color. </li>
                          <li> The colors act as a metric for the pairwise occurrence of a goal with another. A much greener color indicates that this pair appeared more frequently in the set of MUGS. </li>
                          <li> Clicking on these squares will always enforce/unenforce the pairs associated with it. If you just want to enforce/unenforce a single goal, make use of the pink colored squares. These squares mark the
                            intersection of a goal with itself. </li>
                          <li> The pink color serves just as an indicator and nothing else. </li>
                          <li> The bars on top on the matrix shows the number of times a goal appeared in the set of MUGS. Starting from top to bottom,
                           each goal has a bar (from left to right). The first goal in the matrix (from the top) is associated with the first bar (from the left) and so on. </li>
                          <li> The small squares to the gives a global view about the different MUGS. A complete MUGS is identified column-wise via the vertical links between each circle. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Unsolvable Step</h4>

                        <p>
                          In an unsolvable step you can only unenforce goals. Meaning, the matrix represent the set of goals which are conflicting
                          (in other words all goals displayed in the matrix are in already enforced). By clicking on one or a pair of these
                          conflicting goals, you unenforce that goal/pair. This results into a new matrix without that goal. You can always view
                          the goals you unenforced under the selection list as well as re-enforced them by clicking on the trash icon next to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Note that the names of the goals in the matrix will be assigned a different shade of red after your first unenforcement.
                          A very red color indicates that this goal highly conflicts with the other goals in the matrix. Hence, removing it
                          might probably result into a solvable state. The selection result for this step is based on the goals in the matrix.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Solvable Step</h4>

                        <p>
                          In a solvable step you can only enforce goals. Meaning, the matrix represent all goals which are not yet
                          enforced. By clicking on one or a pair of these conflicting goals, you enforce that goal/pair.
                          The result can be viewed in the selection list. This list represents the goals from the original matrix
                          you enforced. You can at any time unenforce (remove) a goal from this list by clicking on the trash icon
                          next to that goal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Note that each goal in the selection will be assigned a different shade of red after your first enforcement, represented
                          by the dot next to it.
                          A very red color indicates that this goal highly conflicts with the other goals in the list. Hence, removing it
                          might probably result into a solvable list. The selection result for this step is based on the goals in the selection list.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The tool is mainly designed to answer questions like:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Why is this step unsolvable?</li>

                            <li>Why isn't this goal satisfied?</li>
                            <li>Can this goal be enforced while keeping the other enforced goals?</li>
                            <li>What if I enforce this goal?</li>
                            <li>How can I achieve this goal?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Beware that the chat assistant cannot answer questions about multiple goals at once.
                            If you want to ask about multiple goals, you have to ask about each goal separately.

                        <p>
                            The tool remembers previous questions and answers and thus supports follow-up questions
                            implicitly referencing previous ones, like in the following example:

                            You can try any question you want. The explainer will try to answer it and if it does not
                            understand your question it will ask you to clarify it. However, the chat explainer is not aware of the utility of goals and thus cannot help you to choose the goals that maximize the utility. It can only help you to understand the conflicts and to find sets of goals that are enforceable.
