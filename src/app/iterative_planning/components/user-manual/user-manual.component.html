                    <p>
                        We are considering tasks where due to limited resources and time 
                        not all goals can be achieved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below you can see a list of sample goals of activities that you want to schedule, 
                        but due to limited time and space in your car this is not possible. 
                        Each goal is assigned a utility indicated on the right with 
                        <mat-icon>workspace_premium</mat-icon> X.
                        The utility indicates how important the goal is.
                        If you click on the panel, you get a more details.
                    </p>

                    <div class="property-list">
						@for(property of samplePlanProperties; track property._id) {
							<app-plan-property-panel [property]="property" [showFormula]="false"></app-plan-property-panel>
						}
					</div>
                    
                    <p>
                        Thus the goal is to find a trade-off between the goals that can be achieved.
                        This means you must find a selection of goals that can be achieved and whose
                        and whose overall utility is maximized.
                        Each selection of goals is called an <span class="highlight">Iteration Step.</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As orientation we display the maximal possible utility and
                        the highest achieved utility as shown below in the top of the list of iteration steps. 
                    </p>

                        Below we create a new iteration with two enforced goals.

                        In addition to the enforced goals it is also possible to select <span class="highlight">Soft Goals</span>.
                        These are goals that the tool will not try achieve, but they will play a role in the conflict analysis
                        between the goals detailed below.

                    <h3>Unsolvable Step</h3>

                    <p>
                        For an unsolvable step the list of the enforced goals is shown. In our example step from above this is:
                    </p>

                    <h4>Enforced Goals</h4>
                    <div class="property-list">
						<app-plan-property-panel [property]="samplePlanProperties[0]" [showFormula]="false"></app-plan-property-panel>

                        <app-plan-property-panel [property]="samplePlanProperties[2]" [showFormula]="false"></app-plan-property-panel>
					</div>

                    <h3>Solvable Step</h3>

                    <p>
                        For a solvable step in addition to the list of the enforced goals the satisfied and unsatisfied soft 
                        goals are shown. Note, the soft goals are selected when a new iteration step is created, but the tool 
                        does not try to achieve them.
                        Nevertheless, they might be satisfied by chance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For our sample step this looks as follows:
                    </p>

                    <h4>Unsatisfied Softgoals</h4>
                    <div class="property-list">

                                    The tool is mainly designed to answer questions like:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Why isn't this softgoal satisfied?</li>
                                    <li>Can this goal be enforced while keeping the other enforced goals?</li>
                                    <li>What if I enforce this goal?</li>
                                    <li>How can I achieve this goal?</li>

                                    The tool remembers previous questions and answers and thus supports follow-up questions implicitly referencing previous ones, like in the following example:

                                    The explainer can infer missing parts in partially implicit question and tells you how it understood your question.
                                    For example:
                                </p>
                                <app-chat [isSenderTyping]="false">
                                    <app-chat-message [role]="'sender'">{{ "Hi! I'm here to help you to understand this planning task. You can ask me any question." }}</app-chat-message>
                                    
                                    <app-chat-markdown-message [role]="'receiver'" [rawMessage]="'Why no yoga'"></app-chat-markdown-message>
                                    <app-chat-markdown-message [role]="'sender'" [rawMessage]="'I understood your question as : &quot;Why is the goal &quot;go to yoga&quot; not satisfied?&quot;.'"></app-chat-markdown-message>

                                    }
                                    <app-chat-input (userInput)="onUserMessage($event)"></app-chat-input>

                                   You can try any question you want. The explainer will try to answer it and if it does not understand your question it will ask you to clarify it.
